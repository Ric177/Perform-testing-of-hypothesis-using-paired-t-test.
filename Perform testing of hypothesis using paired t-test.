The paired sample t-test is also called dependent sample t-test. It’s an univariate test that tests for a significant difference between 2 related variables. An example of this is if you where to collect the blood pressure for an individual before and after some treatment, condition, or time point. The data set contains blood pressure readings before and after an intervention. These are variables “bp_before” and “bp_after”.

 

The hypothesis being test is:

 

·        H0 - The mean difference between sample 1 and sample 2 is equal to 0.


·        H0 - The mean difference between sample 1 and sample 2 is not equal to 0
